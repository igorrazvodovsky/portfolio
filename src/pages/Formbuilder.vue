      A form builder that helps create well-designed forms and integrate them
      with the issue tracking system of the userâ€™s choice.

      <h3>Make sure the resulting forms are good&nbsp;ðŸ™„</h3>
      <p>
        Good forms are notoriously tricky to implement. Our goal was to design
        this process in a way that doesn't require the know-how on the userâ€™s
        part.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <!-- support the admin in creating the mental model of the end-user searching and filling out the form. -->
      <h3>Help people creating forms think in user-centric terms</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to the intricacies of form design, it was crucial to make
        the form creators see their users' perspective. Embedded
        user-centeredness!
      </p>

      <h3>Ensure discoverability</h3>
      <p>
        Navigation had to support all the variety of things and concepts that
        can be found in a large multinational organisation.

      <h3>Reducing the load on support agents</h3>
      <p>
        Support can be one of the largest budget items, especially when they
        operate on a global scale. Form builder helps to shrink that cost by
        improving agent velocityâ€”and in turn, creating happier employees.

        addition to something else.

      <h3>Understanding context</h3>
      <p>
        The application of which the constructor is a part of is only a phase in
        the more general journey people in the company embark on when they need
        support with something. Acknowledgement of this by the team was
        important for a better understanding of where our users come from and
        what happens after they fill out their forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built our team's understanding of the territory by mapping out the
        broader context. That helped achieve clarity and alignment around goals
        for the project, expectations, and potential dependencies and concerns.
        <i>Stakeholder interviews</i> further developed &amp; broadened this
        understanding.

      <h3>Topic definition</h3>
      <p>
        Finding the right form was one of the biggest pain points for the
        previous reincarnation of the app and our goal was to make it easier to
        do. To achieve this we needed to make sure our users name and organize
        their forms in a way that their respective users can relate to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The job of defining the topic of the form is divided between its
        <i>title</i> and the combination of <i>tags</i>. There are two parts to
        the form's definition: the immediate "topic" at hand and the broader
        "subject" space within which the process takes place. <i>E.g.</i> in
        "new user in HR system" the "new user" will be a topic and the "HR
        system" â€“ its context that distinguishes it from other forms dedicated
        to the creation of users. It was important to build our search to
        understand different combinations between the two.<a
          class="footnote"
          href="#footnote-1"
          ><sup>2</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time by phrasing our questions in a goal-oriented manner
        that reminded the future use we nudged our users to imagine how
        colleagues will look for their form.

      <small>
        Another thing that influences the topic is <i>composition</i>. When you
        have a topic that is, let us say geographically divided, you can either
        create one bigger form or several smaller ones. The decision can be
        influenced by the subject matter or personal preference.

        one can do about it besides being aware and taking into account. This is

          Processes our colleagues support vary greatly in complexity and this
          reflected directly in the complexity of their forms. Mostly they are a
          simple combination of two to three simple questions but once in a
          while, you come across something less straightforward.

        I participated in the product roadmap planning cycle by highlighting
        user needs and the state of the teamâ€™s current response to those needs:
        gaps, opportunities, and blindspots. Helped team members frame their

        features they want to build.

        <em>Kano modelling </em> was used for prioritisation of new features.

        always on the lookout for inexpensive ways to add a moment of delight.
