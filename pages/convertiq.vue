    <h1>ConvertIQ</h1>
    <p>
      In 2018, I joined ConvertIQâ€™s product team to design a tool to make, edit
      and analyze social media campaigns. The project became an opportunity to
      try out a more playful visual approach, as I wanted the app to be warm and
      approachable despite the complexity of the subject.
