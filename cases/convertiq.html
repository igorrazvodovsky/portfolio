      <h1>Simplifying social media campaign management</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I worked with ConvertIQ’s product team on the initial design & a
        prototype of a tool to make, edit and analyze social media campaigns.
        The project became an opportunity to try out a more playful visual
        approach. I wanted the app to be warm and approachable despite the
        complexity of the subject.

            where people share their experiences planning, creating and managing
            ad campaigns for their businesses. I selected a wide array of clips
            featuring people from various backgrounds and with different
            technology skills.

            this proved to be a low-cost and enormously insightful way of
            getting to know our users. We were able to identify different
            strategies people use in campaign management, language they use when
            speaking about the subject and mental model of the way it works.
