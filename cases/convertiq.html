      <h1>Simplifying social media campaign management</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I worked with ConvertIQ’s product team on the initial design & a
        prototype of a tool to make, edit and analyze social media campaigns.
        The project became an opportunity to try out a more playful visual
        approach. I wanted the app to be warm and approachable despite the
        complexity of the subject.

          <h3>Three strategic directions considered</h3>
          <p>
            The literature pointed to three distinct approaches to campaign
            management, each with its own trade-offs:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>1. Platform-agnostic approach ∙ <i>chosen</i></dt>
            <dd>
              Create campaigns once, adapt automatically for each platform.
              Prioritizes efficiency over platform-specific optimization.
            </dd>

            <dt class="text-muted">
              2. Platform-native approach ∙ <i>rejected</i>
            </dt>
            <dd class="text-muted">
              Deep integration with each platform's unique features. Would
              require separate workflows for each social network.
            </dd>

            <dt class="text-muted">
              3. Template-first approach ∙ <i>rejected</i>
            </dt>
            <dd class="text-muted">
              Pre-built industry templates (restaurant, retail, services).
              Faster setup but less flexibility for unique businesses.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            We chose the platform-agnostic approach because our user research
            revealed that
            <strong>consistency was more valuable than optimization</strong>
            for small business owners who lacked time to learn platform nuances.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Unconventional research approach</h3>
          <p>
            To validate our strategic direction, I used
            <i>digital ethnography</i> - analyzing YouTube videos<a
              class="footnote"
              href="#footnote-1"
              ><sup>1</sup></a
            >
            where small business owners documented their campaign struggles in
            real-time. Despite some shortcoming<a
              class="footnote"
              href="#footnote-2"
              ><sup>2</sup></a
            >
            this proved to be a low-cost and enormously insightful way of
            getting to know our users:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>People showed actual workflows, not idealized descriptions</li>
            <li>
              We saw authentic frustration points without researcher influence
            </li>
            <li>
              Sample size was larger (50+ videos vs typical 8-12 interviews)
            </li>
            <li>
              Captured behavior across different business types and skill levels
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This research confirmed our strategy: users wanted
            <i>guidance over features</i>. They had access to powerful tools
            (Facebook Ads Manager, etc.) but didn't know how to use them
            effectively.
          </p>

              Although watching Youtube doesn’t seem like proper research, some
              of these clips were similar in quality to what you can get in the
