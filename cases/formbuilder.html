          <h3>Make sure the resulting forms are good&nbsp;ðŸ™„</h3>
          <p>
            Good forms are notoriously tricky to implement. Our goal was to
            design this process in a way that doesn't require the know-how on
            the userâ€™s part.

          <h3>Help people creating forms think in user-centric terms</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the intricacies of form design, it was crucial to
            make the form creators see their users' perspective. Embedded
            user-centeredness!

          <p>
            Support can be one of the largest budget items, especially when they
            operate on a global scale. Form builder helps to shrink that cost by
            improving agent velocityâ€”and in turn, creating happier employees.

            The application of which the constructor is a part of is only a
            phase in the more general journey people in the company embark on
            when they need support with something. Acknowledgement of this by

            We built our team's understanding of the territory by mapping out

            around goals for the project, expectations, and potential
            dependencies and concerns.

          <h3>Topic definition</h3>
          <p>
            Finding the right form was one of the biggest pain points for the
            previous reincarnation of the app and our goal was to make it easier
            to do. To achieve this we needed to make sure our users name and
            organize their forms in a way that their respective users can relate
            to.
          </p>
          <p>
            The job of defining the topic of the form is divided between its
            <i>title</i> and the combination of <i>tags</i>. There are two parts
            to the form's definition: the immediate "topic" at hand and the
            broader "subject" space within which the process takes place.
            <i>E.g.</i> in "new user in HR system" the "new user" will be a
            topic and the "HR system" â€“ its context that distinguishes it from
            other forms dedicated to the creation of users. It was important to
            build our search to understand different combinations between the
            two.<a class="footnote" href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time by phrasing our questions in a goal-oriented manner
            that reminded the future use we nudged our users to imagine how
            colleagues will look for their form.

            <i>Composition</i> is another key factor that influences topic
            organization. When dealing with a topic that has natural divisions,
            such as geographical regions, you face a strategic choice: unify it
            into one comprehensive structure or separate it into multiple
            smaller sections. This decision may be guided by both the nature of
            the subject matter and user's personal preferences.

              Processes our colleagues support vary greatly in complexity and
              this reflected directly in the complexity of their forms. Mostly
              they are a simple combination of two to three simple questions but

              When an answer option is known to be the most frequently selected
              one, it is helpful to select it by default. But defaults are
              tricky things - they're super useful but can be risky too. People
              tend to stick with whatever's already selected, which can nudge
              them down a certain path. We made sure to warn our users about
              this.
